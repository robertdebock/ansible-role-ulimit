## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from `molecule/resources/converge.yml` and is tested on each push, pull request and release.
```yaml
---
- name: converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.ulimit
      ulimit_items:
        - limit_item: nofile
          domain: root
          limit_type: soft
          value: 1048576
        - limit_item: nproc
          domain: root
          limit_type: soft
          value: 1024
        - limit_item: nproc
          domain: root
          limit_type: hard
          value: 2048
```

The machine needs to be prepared in CI this is done using `molecule/resources/prepare.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: prepare
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.bootstrap
```

Also see a [full explanation and example](https://robertdebock.nl/how-to-use-these-roles.html) on how to use these roles.

## [Role Variables](#role-variables)

These variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```yaml
---
# defaults file for ulimit

# Set the default domain. This can be overwritten per item.
ulimit_domain: '*'

# Set the limit type. This can be overwritten per item.
ulimit_limit_type: soft

# Set the file where to write to.
ulimit_dest: /etc/security/limits.conf

# Should a backup of limits.conf be created on changes?
ulimit_backup: yes
```

## [Testing](#testing)

[Unit tests](https://travis-ci.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-ulimit) are done on every commit, pull request, release and periodically.

If you find issues, please register them in [GitHub](https://github.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-ulimit/issues)

Testing is done using [Tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Molecule](https://github.com/ansible/molecule):

[Tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) tests multiple ansible versions.
[Molecule](https://github.com/ansible/molecule) tests multiple distributions.

To test using the defaults (any installed ansible version, namespace: `robertdebock`, image: `fedora`, tag: `latest`):

```
molecule test

# Or select a specific image:
image=ubuntu molecule test
# Or select a specific image and a specific tag:
image="debian" tag="stable" tox
```

Or you can test multiple versions of Ansible, and select images:
Tox allows multiple versions of Ansible to be tested. To run the default (namespace: `robertdebock`, image: `fedora`, tag: `latest`) tests:

```
tox

# To run CentOS (namespace: `robertdebock`, tag: `latest`)
image="centos" tox
# Or customize more:
image="debian" tag="stable" tox
```
